## How It Works

1. **Customer Details:**
   - Enter Customer Name, Phone Number, and a Bill Number (auto/randomly generated).

2. **Item Quantities:**
   - Enter the number of each item purchased in Cosmetics, Grocery, and Others sections.

3. **Calculate Totals:**
   - Click on `Total` to calculate:
     - Total cost of Cosmetics
     - Total cost of Grocery
     - Total cost of Others
   - Taxes are calculated separately for each category.

4. **Generate Bill:**
   - Press `Generate Bill` to create a formatted bill in the receipt area.
   - The receipt lists Product Name, Quantity, Price for each item.

5. **Customer Feedback:**
   - After bill generation, customer satisfaction can be recorded with three options:
     - Not Satisfied
     - Satisfied
     - Very Satisfied

6. **Other Functions:**
   - `Clear`: Resets all fields.
   - `Exit`: Closes the application safely.
